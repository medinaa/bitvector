<h5>Written in C</h5>
<h5>This code is now open-source, please feel free to fork this code and improve it</h5>
This code defines a data type called BitVec which can be used to represent a
bitstring/bitvector. The code also defines several functions which can be used
to find basic information about a bitvector/bitstring. For example, one such
function returns the number of bits turned on.
