<h3>BitVec Data Structure</h3>
<h5>Written in C</h5>

This code defines a data type called BitVec which can be used to represent a
bitstring/bitvector. The code also defines several functions which can be used
to find basic information about a bitvector/bitstring. For example, one such
function returns the number of bits turned on.
