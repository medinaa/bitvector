BitVector Extra Credit


This was actually a very fun little assignment to do. Taking the time to do this
extra credit assignment allows me to further practice the C programming language
and even get ready for the upcoming final. 

Before doing this assignment, I had never actually used the bitwise operators or
implemented a data structure that behaves like a bitvector. So this was a great
opportunity to do so. 

This data type represents a bitvector or bitstring. It may take in a character
string and use it to create a BitVec data type. It also holds the total amount
of bits used inside the bitvector.

I have implemented a few functions that can be used to manipulate the bitvector such 
as bv_set/reset(). These functions can set the value of a particular bit inside a
bitvector. Also bv_flip() can be used to flip the value of a bit at a specific
position. 

I have also implemented a number of functions that tell you some information
about the bitvector such as the test_all/none/any(). These functions will give
information on how many bits are set to 1. bv_count() will report back on the
number of bits that are set to 1.

Finally, I have included a clean up function to free memory that has been
allocated for the bitvector data type. This is a function that most C data
structures should have.
